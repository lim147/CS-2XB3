TODO:
- test cases
- double check the documentation, or add documentation if there isn't any
- sort filtered crime list by how recent the occurrance is

Possible implementations if you feel like doing it:
- assigning a rating based on the type of crime
- assigning a rating based on how recent the crime was

TODO List that Alice is currently working on
3. Build digraph where nodes are the intersection and edges are the crime rating
4. identify the best path from the output from Dijkstras
