Possible implementations if you feel like doing it:
- assigning a rating based on the type of crime
- assigning a rating based on how recent the crime was

TODO List that Alice is currently working on
1. For loop through list of paths
2. For loop through path's intersections
	- Find radius of intersection
	- Put crimes that fall under the radius into intersection's crimes list
	- Sort intersection's list by how recent the occurrance is
	- Find crime rating of intersection
3. Build digraph where nodes are the intersection and edges are the crime rating
4. Figure out how to identify the best path from the output from Dijkstras
