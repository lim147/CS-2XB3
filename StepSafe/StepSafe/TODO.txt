
	1. Algorithm to find intersection points on a street  -  In progress
	2. Function to find all crimes within the sufficient radius
	3. Function to find distance from a point to all crimes within the sufficient radius
    4. Store distance values in a BST - In progress by Alice

	Comments:
	If all the crime data are on intersections, and we are able to find all the intersections along
		the route. Do we need to do 2,3, and 4?
