	1. Algorithm to find intersection points on a street  -  In progress
	2. Given a start and end point, find the middle point and then a sufficient radius
	3. Function to find all crimes within the sufficient radius
	4. Function to find distance from a point to all crimes within the sufficient radius
        5. Store distance values in a BST - In progress by Alice






	Comments:
		If all the crime data are on intersections, and we are able to find all the intersections along
		the route. Do we need to do 2,3, and 4?
